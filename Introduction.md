#Introduction
<br>
<p>Every year there are new students coming to the university and in order to participate in the Metropolia's activities it is important to know the school's facilities: computer rooms, auditoriums, laboratories, libraries, gym, cafeteria etc. The area of the university is rather big and it can be quite complicated for the newcomers to orientate at first. 

<p>We came up with the idea that instead of regular guided tour around the campus during the orientation week we can create an interactive game for the students. This game will not only help to get familiar with the university area but also will demonstrate and advertise the opportunities of todayâ€™s media technologies.

<p>The game is implemented as a mobile application. The students are divided into groups of 3 to 5 people.The goal of each team is to get first through all the checkpoints around the campus.
<p>Main idea of the game:
* Each team gets a group name and password from the tutor as soon as the teams are formed
* By login under same name and password team members get same destinations list
* The checkpoint is scored when the QR code is scanned in the required destination
* When the QR code is scanned the team gets a check mark next to the destination name in the list.
* The first team who gets all the checkpoints tagged wins 
<p>Main features of the game:
* Direction list: In order to find the destination player has to follow given directions. The list of directions and metric distances from point to point appears as soon as the destination has been chosen. 
* Compass tool: In order to complicate the task directions are given in cardinal and ordinal format and players has to use compass to follow them. 
* Radar tool: The tool is created so that the teams can interact with each other. Radar will show if there are other team players around as soon as the tool is opened, but at the same time it will uncover the position of the team. Tool allows placing a mine or a compass bomb that can slow down other teams on their way. Also it allows to see the same obstacles on their way. 
           <p> * Mine: It is possible to place a mine in the current position. The penalty for "stepping" on the mine is 5 mins extra time for the total team time result.
           <p> * Compass Bomb: It is possible to place a compass bomb in the current position. If the player steps on the compass bomb, the compasses of the team will stop showing right cardinal directions during next 5 min.

In order to involve some strategic thinking each team has limited amount of mines and bombs they can use.
Each of the described tools is provided on the separate view and the idea is that each team member can be in charge of different tool. This will help to have everyone in the team involved in the process. 


<p>The main idea to involve all team members of the group is to log in to the same team views from different smart phones and to use different tools (views) at the same time.
In overall the game will create much more interactive way to present the university facilities to the new students and demonstrate the technological side of the studying process in Metropolia.
