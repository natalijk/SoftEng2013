##Non-functional system requirements
 
###Usability:

To ensure that the system is easy to use, 
there was made a research while trying to imagine the game only looking at the user interface. After that was decided to remove some buttons.

It was decided to make tabs for easy navigation. Every member of the team will manage with his own tab, 
so it makes the game easier (if every player had to use all the functions of the game by himself at the same time  there would be much mess). Any actions needs no more than 3 clicks.

There are no useless buttons or much unnecessary information. The program is light and easy-to-understand. 

The front page will allow the player to log in. After that it will be possible to choose a
checkpoint and follow the instructions. All the instructions are brief and non-complicated. 
The game requires to be attentive and to be able to use a smartphone.

###Reliability:
              
Before starting the game every player has to log in. If the login or password are not correct the system will ask to log in again. Noone can start playing until the Tutor has started the game. This makes the game honest, so that all the players could start playing at the same time and there was no false start. 

All the information will be stored in the secure place and protected.

Possible system failures can be:
+ Incorrect Username/Password --> log in again


              
###Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. 
             How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? 
             What metrics would you use?
             
System has to be able to work with a lot of people at the same time. The most crucial requirement for the system is to update immediately, so that the information about checkpoints, mines and compass bombs
