##Non-functional system requirements
 
#Usability: how do you ensure that your system is easy to use?

To ensure that the system is easy to use, 
we have imagined that we know nothing about this game and tried to survive having only interface images. 
We decided to make tabs for easy navigation. Every member of the team will manage with his own tab, 
so it makes the game easier 
(it would be messy if every player had to use all the functions of the game by himself at the same time).
We have not put any useless buttons or much unnecessary. The program is light and easy-to-understand. 


#Reliability: how do you ensure that your system is reliable? 
              List the possible system failures and how the system reacts to them
              
#Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. 
             How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? 
             What metrics would you use?
