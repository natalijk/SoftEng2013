##The situation?

Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent
or copied to websites, application and accounts. There is also the ability for a onetime key creation to be
used once in a transaction without the risk of reused by others for any reason.

##How it works

User has a master key and owns a database;
Master key unlocks database;
Database is divided into groups/subgroups;
Groups/subgroups consist of entries;
Entries send data to webpages/applications;
Database interacts webpages/applications;
Algorithms for encryption encrypts master key;
Algorithms for encryption generates one time password;
One ltime password is used in webpages/applications;
