## Use Cases

* What the system (will) do?
    * It provides a very secure, encrypted database where the user can store all his passwords, usernames, 
email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them. With one master key the user can
get access to all of this.
   The different use cases can be summarized as the following:
      * Manage password databases (Create, open, save, print and save)
      * Manage groups of passwords among the databases.
      * Manage the password entries.

* Use case diagram?
      * Not really, they use another shit for describing the stuff

* How cases are described, how much details?
      * The use cases are specified as "system features", and each scenario is fully documented with a description of
        the use case, the workflow and the functional requirements. This is done by listing the workflow and the 
        requirements, rather than drawing a use case diagram.
      
## General structure of the system

* What chart techniques are used? Why?
      * This document only includes one chart, which is used for showing the main components of the system and the
        relationships between them. It gives a simplified version of the system and makes it easier to understand.

## Functional & non-functional requirements)
* Listed?
   * The functional requirements are presented under its corresponding use case.
     The non-functional requirements are listed at the end of the document.

* Measurable/traceability? (is it possible to check from the upcoming end product if a feature / requirement is implemented or not?)
   *

## How does (will) it look?
* UI examples / views?

Are the pictures mockups or screenshots from existing system?
